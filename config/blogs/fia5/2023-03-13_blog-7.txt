this week we decided that in I should work on the code to move the pieces and rotate the board so that I dont have to do it Manually which was taking hours upon hours, so I started to work on that, I made it so the pressing the enter key rotates the board with a little help from george, and started to make the pieces move however for this I did a load of research into java fx, but it kept giving me null pointer exeptions on click and I dont know why, It may be an issue with the fxml, so I may need someone to help me with this :/
