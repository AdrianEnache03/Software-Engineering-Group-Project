 Assigned actions
 ================

ACTION: fia5 - presentation, make changes based on feedback add screens by 13/02/23.

worked on the powerpoint, however as there Were a lot of slides to do, and for every slide the board needs to rotated and the code isn't there in order to rotate it, I needed to do all the rotations by hand for every slide, which takes rather a long time per screen, so it is still not complete for every move

hours: 9
